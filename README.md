# Skeletonisation
# My Final Year Uni Thesis - extended.

# Abstract

This report documents the design and implementation of five algorithms 
for the skeletonisation (or thinning) of monochromatic images.  This also 
involves a discussion of the required format for the image data and a 
design and implementation of  a loader and saver for such an image using 
the Sun Microsytems Rasterfile format, as well as creation of ASCII data. 

Each of the algorithms is discussed in its own chapter, which include 
pseudo code and fragments of actual code.  Also included is preliminary 
test data, used to prove whether the algorithms do or do not work, along 
with discussions of any major problems.  The support code, used along 
with the actual algorithm code, is also discussed in brief.  

A chapter is also included which shows the results of test on three specific 
images, along with timer information on the supplied algorithms, all in all 
showing which of the implemented algorithms was best suited for our 
purposes.

Appendices are included showing the all of the algorithm source code and 
the more important areas of the support code, as well as a users guide for 
the executables.
