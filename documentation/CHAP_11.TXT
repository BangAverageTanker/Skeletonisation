11 Conclusion

11.1 Overall effectiveness

The testing shows that all but one of the implemented algorithms could be 
used successfully to thin monochromatic images of cell structures.  Of 
those that work, the best is Stewarts algorithm.  This creates well 
connected skeletons, with no erosion, and is the fastest of the implemented 
algorithms. 

11.2 Aims of the project

The aims of the project have been met, with five algorithms implemented.  
Each has been tested on the same test data, with particular interest in the 
results from images of cell structures.

However, no newer algorithms were implemented then those initially 
supplied , due to some selected algorithms not becoming available before 
the end of the project.  One such newer algorithm was suggested in the 
article 'Proceedings of the 12th IAPR International Conference on Pattern 
Recognition', volume 1, pages 546-8.  This article was published in the last 
quarter of 1995 and so is significantly newer then any of those 
implemented.

11.3 Constraints

The only constraint of this project was the use of zero as image data, and 
one as background data.  All of the implemented algorithms are able to 
produce images in this form.  The implemented algorithms can produce 
the data in either SUN rasterfile format, or ASCII text.  The user is able 
to view the skeletonisation process at the iterative level, with differing 
levels of information available depending on the algorithm (see appendix 
C - users guide).  This could help if any modifications to the algorithms 
were intended.
