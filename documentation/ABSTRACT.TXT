Abstract

This report documents the design and implementation of five algorithms 
for the skeletonisation (or thinning) of monochromatic images.  This also 
involves a discussion of the required format for the image data and a 
design and implementation of  a loader and saver for such an image using 
the Sun Microsytems Rasterfile format, as well as creation of ASCII data. 

Each of the algorithms is discussed in its own chapter, which include 
pseudo code and fragments of actual code.  Also included is preliminary 
test data, used to prove whether the algorithms do or do not work, along 
with discussions of any major problems.  The support code, used along 
with the actual algorithm code, is also discussed in brief.  

A chapter is also included which shows the results of test on three specific 
images, along with timer information on the supplied algorithms, all in all 
showing which of the implemented algorithms was best suited for our 
purposes.

Appendices are included showing the all of the algorithm source code and 
the more important areas of the support code, as well as a users guide for 
the executables.

Acknowledgements

I am grateful to several people, who have assisted me during my project.  
Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor, Mr. Eddie Dodds for his help 
in obtaining and understanding the algorithms, and his enthusiasm for 
the project in general.  I would also like to thank my housemates, Lesley, 
Chris and Sharon for insisting I go and work on my report, and continually 
harassing me for a running word count.  Thanks must also go to Sharon 
for proof reading my report, which is by its nature a very difficult subject 
to understand.  Also I must thank Petri Nordlund for writing 'Executive' 
and the 'Executive timer', without which I wouldn't have been able to 
achieve any accurate timing of the program.
